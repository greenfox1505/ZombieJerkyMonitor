# Monitor 2: Electric Boogaloo

My old Monitor server is old. I'd like to enhance it.

Current Monitor Features:
* Minimal Install
* Simple URL driven API (Lets clients use pure bash with wget to push to servers)
* Shows current IP address 

Feature Wishless for Monitor 2:
* Note IP address changes (how would I clear this? IP history button?)
* Monitor system stats:
    * CPU
    * RAM
    * Net/DiskIO?
* Push notifications ("This thing happend/You Have Uncleared Notifications")
    * IP Changes
    * Disconnects
    * Down detection
    * High Stats
* Database?!
